Here is what I accomplished today:
* I made this Git repo.
* I followed the [Chrome extension getting started guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) to make a basic Chrome extension.
* I modified the basic Chrome extension to identify if a webpage is a Wikipedia article, and if so, to highlight all other hyperlinked Wikipedia articles.
